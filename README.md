# Citizen Science App

This is the source code for [**Species Tracker**](http://species.wq.io/), a concept for a mobile app for biodiversity monitoring.  During the [Citizen Science 2015 Hackfest](http://scistarter.com/blog/2015/02/reports-hackfest-citizen-science-association-conference/), we used the [wq framework](http://wq.io/) to create a simple prototype that allows anyone to upload photos and GPS coordinates together with species information.
